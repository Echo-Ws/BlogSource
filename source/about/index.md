I am Shuang.

Graduated from [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) as an honored bachelor in Fall 2018, now I study in CS in [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/).

This blog is used to record:
1.  My thought, (under "杂记")
2.  Learning notes,
3.  <del>Leetcode</del> (now I use Notability to record my solutions. So visitors may oly find a few easy problems here)
